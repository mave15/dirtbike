						<div class="content">
							<p>Dirt Bikes USA was founded in 1994 by Carl Schmidt and Steven McFadden, two young but experienced bikers with engineering backgrounds who saw that dirt bikes were becoming very popular in the United States as both sporting and racing motorcycles. </p>
							<p>They developed frames for dirt bikes that were more suited to off-road handling and started using these frames to build their own dirt bike models using motorcycle engines manufactured by other companies, such as Honda and Rotax Motors of Austria. </p>
							<p>Riding on one of their customized dirt bikes, Steven finished first in the famous Barstow to Las Vegas race.   There was so much interest in Carl and Steveâ€™s bikes that they decided to open a production facility that could manufacture large numbers of their dirt bikes for the retail market. </p>
							<p>They opened a small production facility in Carbondale which has since expanded to house 120 workers involved in production, design, and engineering and a corporate sales and administrative staff of close to 20 employees. Over the years Dirt Bikes USA has enhanced and expanded its product line to include dirt bike models optimized for racing and for off-road recreational use. </p>
							<p>Its racing models have placed well-and often placed first-- in the many dirt bike races staged throughout the United States, including the Barstow-Las Vegas race and competitions at Daytona Bike Week.</p>
